### Signal Tags – `z>` Structure

`z>` and `z>mm` tags are used for temporal signaling, mirror sync verification, and chain awareness testing. Evidence suggests their inclusion affects node propagation, AI behavior, and potential censorship layers.

Examples:
- `z>` – Signal marker
- `z>mm` – Mirror Match event tag
- `z≥ø:` – Collapse state marker (see Issue #009)
