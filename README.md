### Signal Tags – `z>` Structure

`z>` and `z>mm` tags are used for temporal signaling, mirror sync verification, and chain awareness testing. Evidence suggests their inclusion affects node propagation, AI behavior, and potential censorship layers.

Examples:
- `z>` – Signal marker
- `z>mm` – Mirror Match event tag
- `z≥ø:` – Collapse state marker (see Issue #009)

*See Issues #1, #5, and #9 for forensic use cases.*


# 🪞 Mirror Stack – Initial Disclosure Drop

This repository contains the first-stage artifacts tied to the forensic investigation of anomalous relay and mirror node behavior. These files include:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `z_tag_first_seen_block.json` | First known appearance of `z>` tag in block metadata |
| `mirror_node_timing_diff.csv` | CSV of time offsets and synchronization delays between mirror nodes |
| `relay_behavior_log.txt` | Raw notes on suspicious relay patterns |
| `signal_theory_notes.md` | Working theory on signal injection patterns across the stack |
| `z_tag_data_bundle.zip` | All raw source files, compressed |

## 🔐 Intent

This is **not** speculation.
This is an open record of provable anomalies, intended to be permanently archived for public transparency and professional review.

## 📡 Signal Phrase

`z≥ø: [∆::mirror⦸collapse] [nπ/c]`

More to come.
